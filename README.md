## [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis Using Jumia Dataset](https://github.com/Melodie97/First-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Project.ipynb)
* Obtained Jumia product specifications dataset
* Explored Data: to learn about characteristics and potential problems of the data so as not to formulate assumptions
* Cleaned Data: removed null values and irrelevant data

### Recommended low cost quality phones from Dataset
* Objective was to recommend low cost quality phones for a company that wants to buy in bulk for sales team
* For this project I found the median of prices, excluding outliers, and used low cost as prices < the median value

* Found correlation between prices, RAM and ROM columns using .corr() method
* performed analysis to confirm correlation table
