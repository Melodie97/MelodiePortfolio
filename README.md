Data Science Portfolio

## [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis Using Jumia Dataset](https://github.com/Melodie97/First-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Project.ipynb)
* Obtained Jumia product specifications dataset
* Explored Data: to learn about characteristics and potential problems of the data so as not to formulate assumptions
* Cleaned Data: removed null values and irrelevant data

### Recommended low cost quality phones from Dataset
* Objective was to recommend low cost quality phones for a company that wants to buy in bulk for sales team
* For this project I found the median of prices, excluding outliers, and used low cost as prices < the median value

## [Project 2: Correlation in Python Using Jumia Dataset](https://github.com/Melodie97/First-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Specifications%20.ipynb)
* Found correlation between prices, RAM and ROM columns using .corr() method
* performed analysis to confirm correlation table 

## [Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis on Covid19 Dataset Using SQL](https://github.com/Melodie97/SQL-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Covid%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)
* Obtained Covid19 dataset from OurWorldinData.com
* Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
* Looked at Total cases vs Total Death per country
* Looked at Total cases vs Population per country
* Looked at Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to population
* Looked at Countries with the Highest Death Count per population
* Looked at continents with the Highest Death Count per population
* Got Global numbers of people infected and total deaths
* Used CTE and Temp Tables to perform Calculation on Partition By
